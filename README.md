# Portfolio Optimization

Analyzed the behaviour of stocks and their returns.

Used K-means clustering to see whether certain stocks exhibited similar behaviour during a time period.

Created a suitable portfolio using opitmal portfolio weights across stocks using GMVP (Global Minimum Variance Portfolio) to minimize the variance of portfolio returns.
